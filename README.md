🎹 Matt’s Magical MIDI Machine

A browser-based MIDI + audio playground that mirrors a real MIDI keyboard on screen.
Keys light up. Pads hit hard. Knobs move when you touch them. Mouse, typing keyboard, and MIDI all stay in sync.

Built to feel immediate, visual, and fun. Not a DAW. Not a toy. Somewhere in between.

✨ Features

Web MIDI support (Chrome / Edge)

Audio-only mode (no MIDI required)

On-screen keyboard with bright neon feedback

Drum pads (pads only, no piano nonsense)

Knobs mapped to MIDI CCs and mouse drag

Typing keyboard support for notes and pads

LOUD mode for punchier drums and pads

Splash screen with clear start options

Everything you press lights up onscreen, always

🖥 Requirements

A modern browser

✅ Chrome (recommended)

✅ Edge

⚠️ Firefox: audio works, MIDI support is limited

Optional: a MIDI keyboard or controller

No installs. No build step. Just HTML.

🚀 How to Use

Open Matt's Magical MIDI Machine.html in your browser

Click Start with MIDI or Audio + Typing Keyboard

If using MIDI:

Plug in your device

Select it from the Input dropdown
